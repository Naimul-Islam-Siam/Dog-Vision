## Predicting the Breeds of Dogs from Images

We are building an end to end deep learning multi class image classifier project using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub.

- #### Problem Definition
Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

- #### Data
We are using "Dog Breed Identification" dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

- #### Evaluation
For evaluating we will have to submit a file with prediction probabilities for each of the different dog breeds of each test image.
